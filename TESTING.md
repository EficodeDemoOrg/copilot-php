  - Adding comments to tasks
  - Comment storage and retrieval
  - Comment validation
- **Tagging System**
  - Tag creation and management
  - Task-tag associations
  - Tag filtering and search
- **Data Storage & Persistence**
  - JSON file storage operations
  - Data integrity and file locking
  - Error handling for storage operations
- **Security Features**
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - CSRF protection
  - XSS prevention
- **User Interface Components**
  - Task filtering and display
  - Form submissions and validations
  - JavaScript interactions

### Out of Scope:
- **Third-party Dependencies**
  - PHPDotEnv library functionality (we only test our usage of it)
  - PHP built-in functions and extensions
- **Web Server Configuration**
  - Apache/Nginx specific configurations
  - PHP runtime environment setup
- **Browser Compatibility Testing**
  - Cross-browser JavaScript compatibility (documented as supported: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+)

## 3. Types of Testing

### Unit Tests:
- **Purpose:** To test individual functions, methods, and components in isolation
- **Tools:** PHPUnit 9.5
- **Location:** `tests/Unit/`
- **Coverage Includes:**
  - Model classes (Task, Comment, Tag)
  - Service layer methods (TaskService, CommentService, TagService)
  - Utility classes (Validator, Security)
  - Storage layer operations (JsonStorage, CommentStorage)

### Integration Tests:
- **Purpose:** To test how multiple components work together and data flows between layers
- **Tools:** PHPUnit with test data files
- **Location:** `tests/Integration/`
- **Coverage Includes:**
  - Controller-Service-Storage interactions
  - Model relationships and dependencies
  - End-to-end data persistence workflows
  - Configuration loading and environment setup

### Functional/Acceptance Tests:
- **Purpose:** To test complete user workflows and business logic from the user's perspective
- **Tools:** PHPUnit with HTTP testing capabilities
- **Location:** `tests/Functional/`
- **Coverage Includes:**
  - Complete task management workflows
  - Comment creation and display
  - Tag management and filtering
  - Error handling and user feedback

### Manual QA Testing:
- **Purpose:** To manually verify complex user workflows, check user experience, and perform exploratory testing
- **Process:** Manual testing checklist covering all user-facing features before releases
- **Focus Areas:**
  - User interface responsiveness
  - Error message clarity
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Performance under load

## 4. Tools & Environment üõ†Ô∏è

### Testing Frameworks:
- **PHPUnit 9.5** - Primary testing framework for unit, integration, and functional tests
- **Composer** - Dependency management and test script execution

### Development Tools:
- **PHP 7.4+** - Minimum runtime requirement
- **JSON** - Data storage format for test fixtures
- **Built-in PHP Server** - Local development and testing environment

### Bug Tracking:
- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reporting and tracking
- **GitHub Pull Requests** - Code review and change management

### CI/CD (Automation):
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated test execution (when configured)
- **Composer Scripts** - Local test execution automation

### Test Environment:
Tests are run against isolated test data files to ensure reproducible results:
- Test database: Separate JSON files in `tests/fixtures/` directory
- Environment: Test-specific configuration with `APP_ENV=testing`
- Data Reset: Test data is reset before each test run
- File Permissions: Tests verify proper file access and locking mechanisms

## 5. Test Execution & Automation ‚öôÔ∏è

### When are tests run?
- **On Every Commit:** Unit and integration tests should be run via GitHub Actions on every push
- **Before Deployment:** Complete test suite including functional tests
- **During Development:** Developers run tests locally before committing changes
- **Nightly Builds:** Full regression testing with performance benchmarks

### How to run tests locally?

#### Install Dependencies:
```bash
# Install project dependencies
composer install
```

#### Run All Tests:
```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests
composer test

# Run PHPUnit directly with verbose output
./vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose

# Run tests with coverage report
./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/
```

#### Run Specific Test Categories:
```bash
# Run only unit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/

# Run only integration tests  
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/

# Run only functional tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Functional/

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Models/TaskTest.php
```

#### Development Server for Testing:
```bash
# Start development server for manual testing
composer serve
# Application available at http://localhost:8000
```

## 6. Bug & Defect Management üêû

### Discovery:
Bugs are identified through:
- **Failed Automated Tests:** CI/CD pipeline failures or local test failures
- **Manual QA Testing:** Issues found during exploratory testing
- **User Reports:** Issues reported through GitHub Issues
- **Code Review:** Problems identified during pull request reviews

### Reporting:
1. **Create GitHub Issue** with clear title following format: `[Bug] Component: Brief Description`
2. **Include Required Information:**
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Environment details (PHP version, OS)
   - Relevant error messages or logs
   - Screenshots if UI-related

### Prioritization:
Issues are prioritized using GitHub labels:
- **Critical:** Data loss, security vulnerabilities, application crashes
- **High:** Major feature broken, significant user impact
- **Medium:** Minor feature issues, UI problems
- **Low:** Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests

### Assignment & Resolution:
1. **Triage:** Product Owner or Team Lead assigns priority and developer
2. **Development:** 
   - Developer reproduces the issue
   - Implements fix with corresponding test case
   - Ensures no regression in existing functionality
3. **Verification:**
   - Code review by team member
   - Automated test validation
   - Manual verification if required
4. **Closure:** Issue marked as resolved with reference to fixing commit/PR

### Test Coverage Requirements:
- **New Bugs:** Must include test case that would have caught the bug
- **Regression Prevention:** All bug fixes require corresponding test
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation if bug reveals gaps

### Quality Gates:
- All tests must pass before merging to main branch
- Code coverage should not decrease with new changes
- Critical bugs require immediate hotfix process
- Security vulnerabilities follow responsible disclosure timeline
