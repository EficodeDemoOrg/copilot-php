# GitHub Copilot Comprehensive Training Exercises

Welcome to your comprehensive GitHub Copilot training journey! These exercises are designed to progressively learn GitHub Copilot's features across different environments and interaction modes through hands-on practice with our PHP Task Manager project.

## Phase 1: Multi-Environment Copilot Basics

### Exercise 1.1: Copilot Across Different Environments

1. **VS Code Environment**
   - Open `index.php` in VS Code
   - Type `// Generate a welcome message` and observe auto-completion
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Shift+I`) to open Copilot Chat
   - Ask: "Explain what this file does"

### Exercise 1.2: Understanding Interaction Modes

1. **Ask Mode Practice**
   - In Copilot Chat, ask: "What are the main components of this PHP application?"
   - Try: "How is data persistence handled in this project?"
   - Notice how Ask mode provides explanations and guidance

2. **Edit Mode Exploration**  
   - Select a function in `src/Models/Task.php`
   - In chat, switch to Edit mode (if available in your interface)
   - Request: "Add input validation to this method"
   - Observe how Edit mode focuses on direct code changes

3. **Agent Mode with /new**
   - Type: `/new Create a simple PHP utility class for date formatting`
   - Notice how Agent mode creates complete new implementations
   - Try: `/new Generate a configuration class for this project`

**Learning Goal:** Understand when and how to use different Copilot interaction modes.

### Exercise 1.3: First Steps with Code Suggestions

1. **Explore Auto-Suggestions**
   - Open `src/Models/Task.php`
   - Position your cursor after line 50 and press Enter
   - Type `// Method to check if task is overdue` and press Enter
   - Watch Copilot suggest a method implementation
   - Try accepting the suggestion with `Tab`, or cycle through alternatives with `Alt+]` and `Alt+[`

2. **Practice with Comments**
   - Add this comment: `// Calculate the age of this task in days`
   - Let Copilot suggest the implementation
   - Notice how descriptive comments lead to better suggestions

3. **Experiment with Function Names**
   - Start typing `public function formatCreated` and see what Copilot suggests
   - Try `public function isComplete` and observe the different suggestion

**Learning Goal:** Understand how Copilot uses context and comments to generate relevant code suggestions.

### Exercise 1.4: Exploring the Suggestion Interface

1. **Navigation Practice**
   - Open `src/Utils/Validator.php`
   - Add a comment: `// Validate email format using regex`
   - Use `Alt+]` to cycle through different suggestions
   - Use `Ctrl+Enter` to open the suggestions panel for more options

2. **Partial Acceptance**
   - Start typing a function and accept only part of a suggestion using `Ctrl+â†’`
