> Instead, open the file, select the method you want to analyze, open inline chat and use your prompt.

1. **Minimal vs. Maximum Context**
   - Ask the same question with different context levels:
     - Minimal: `How do I add validation?`
     - Medium: `How do I add validation to #file?`
     - Maximum: `@project How do I add consistent validation across all controllers following the existing patterns?`
   - Compare response quality and relevance

2. **Context Layering Technique**
   - Start broad: `@project What's the validation strategy in this project?`
   - Layer specific: `#file How does this controller handle validation?`
   - Notice how each layer builds understanding

3. **Cross-Reference Optimization**
   - Use multiple file references: `Compare validation approaches in TaskController.php vs CommentController.php`
   - Combine selection with file context: `How does #selection relate to patterns in #file?`
   - Mix variables effectively: `#codebase #selection Where else is this pattern used?`

### Exercise 7.2: Context Quality Assessment
